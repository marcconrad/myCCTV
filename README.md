# myCCTV
Simple browser based CCTV system

Well, this is me learning how to do stuff on GitHub; so all might be still a bit experimental. 

For more information on the project feel free to contact me under http://dr.marcconrad.com/ 

For installation and quickstart just do (on Windows): 

(1) Download and istall wamp https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/ or some other webserver. Run it.

(2) Add a folder (say, cam) to your webserver, e.g. C:\wamp64\www\cam on the standard wampserver setup

(3) Download mycctv.zip https://github.com/marcconrad/myCCTV/blob/master/updatefromgit.php?raw=yes

(4) Copy the file install.php from the zip file into the folder you have created, e.g.  C:\wamp64\www\cam

(5) With your favourite browser navigate to http://localhost/cam/updatefromgit.php

(6) You can start the camera via the main site, choose a camera, then: ðŸ”¨, Setup, Start Cam. 

(7) Have fun. 

If you want to use the camera and the server on different devices you can expose your localhost via (e.g.) https://ngrok.com/

(7) Contact me under http://dr.marcconrad.com/ if you like what you see. 

If you already own a webserver, obviously you can install it there. Just move the install.php where you need it and run it from a browser. You need https for the camera to work.
