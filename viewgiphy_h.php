<h1>What is this about?</h1>
It is well known that the main purpose of the Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular is the consumption of cat themed videos. 
This site provides the opportunity to test the capabilities of your software device in relation to showing videos of cats. The higher the score the better. 

<p>The videos were made as animted gifs using the <a href="https://github.com/marcconrad/myCCTV">myCTTV</a> software
    and then uploaded to <a href="https://giphy.com/channel/sanfoh">Giphy</a></p>
